### Repository (04/January/2021) 
    1. The idea here to have a repository that bring any data object from anywhere (e.g. firebase)
    2. The methods are here as usuel (e.g. getAll, deleteById, insert and getbyid(not sure)). We don't need any Insert or delete to the 
       event for now, because the orgniazer will do that direct from the firebase. 
    3. We will use maybe SQLite cache for saving data inside the phone to save internet request access.
